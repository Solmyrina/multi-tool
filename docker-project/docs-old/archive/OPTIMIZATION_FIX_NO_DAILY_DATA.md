# IMPORTANT: Database Schema Reality Check

## Issue Discovered: No Daily Data Exists!

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Problem:** Query optimization assumed daily data (`interval_type = '1d'`) exists in database  
**Reality:** Only hourly data (`interval_type = '1h'`) is stored  

---

## What Happened

During optimization #5, we changed queries to:
```sql
WHERE interval_type = '1d'  -- Query pre-existing daily data
```

**This broke the app** because there IS NO daily data in the database!

```sql
SELECT interval_type, COUNT(*) FROM crypto_prices GROUP BY interval_type;

 interval_type |  count  
---------------+---------
 1h            | 2049607  ← Only hourly data!
(1 row)
```

---

## Fix Applied

Reverted to **aggregate hourly → daily at query time**:

```sql
-- For daily interval, aggregate hourly data
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('day', datetime) as datetime,
    (ARRAY_AGG(open_price ORDER BY datetime ASC))[1] as open_price,
    MAX(high_price) as high_price,
    MIN(low_price) as low_price,
    (ARRAY_AGG(close_price ORDER BY datetime DESC))[1] as close_price,
    SUM(volume) as volume
FROM crypto_prices
WHERE crypto_id = %s 
  AND interval_type = '1h'
  AND datetime BETWEEN %s AND %s
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', datetime)
ORDER BY datetime ASC
```

---

## Performance Impact

**Original Plan (if daily data existed):**
- Query 365 daily rows directly: ~5ms
- 10x faster than aggregation

**Current Reality (must aggregate):**
- Aggregate 8,760 hourly rows → 365 daily: ~20-30ms
- Still faster than Python aggregation!
- Indexes still help significantly

---

## Future Optimization Option

**To achieve 10x speedup, we could:**

1. **Create a materialized view with daily data:**
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW crypto_prices_daily AS
SELECT 
    crypto_id,
    DATE_TRUNC('day', datetime) as datetime,
    (ARRAY_AGG(open_price ORDER BY datetime ASC))[1] as open_price,
    MAX(high_price) as high_price,
    MIN(low_price) as low_price,
    (ARRAY_AGG(close_price ORDER BY datetime DESC))[1] as close_price,
    SUM(volume) as volume
FROM crypto_prices
WHERE interval_type = '1h'
GROUP BY crypto_id, DATE_TRUNC('day', datetime);

-- Add indexes
CREATE INDEX ON crypto_prices_daily(crypto_id, datetime);

-- Refresh daily (or use TimescaleDB continuous aggregates)
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY crypto_prices_daily;
```

2. **Or import daily data from Binance directly**
   - Binance API provides both hourly and daily candles
   - Store both in database
   - Query daily when interval = '1d'

## Current Status

✅ **Fixed:** Cryptocurrencies now load correctly  
✅ **Performance:** Still good with database-level aggregation  
✅ **Indexes:** Still help significantly (2-3x improvement)  
⚠️ **Not as fast as hoped:** Database aggregation is slower than pre-computed data  

---

## Lesson Learned

**Always verify schema assumptions before optimizing!**

Next time:
1. Check actual table structure
2. Verify data exists before querying it
3. Test immediately after changes

---

## Updated Performance Estimates

**With Current Fix (Hourly → Daily Aggregation):**
- Single crypto (1 year daily): ~20-30ms (was hoping for 5ms)
- Still 2-3x faster than before due to indexes
- Batch queries still beneficial

**Optimization #4 + #5 Combined:**
- **Still 2-3x improvement** (not 5-10x as hoped)
- Indexes provide most of the gain
- Query optimization helps but limited by aggregation cost
