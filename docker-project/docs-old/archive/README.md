# Archived Documentation

This folder contains documentation files that have been consolidated into comprehensive guides.

## Why Archived?

These files contained valuable information but were:
- **Redundant**: Multiple files covering the same topics
- **Phase-specific**: Detailed implementation logs for specific development phases
- **Superseded**: Replaced by more comprehensive consolidated guides

## Archive Date

**October 8, 2025**

## Consolidated Into

| Archived Files | Consolidated Into | Topic |
|----------------|-------------------|-------|
| 13 optimization phase files | `OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md` | Complete optimization journey (250x improvement) |

| 3 crypto backtest files | `CRYPTO_BACKTEST_TECHNICAL.md` | Backtesting system technical details |
| 1 Redis memory file | `REDIS_GUIDE.md` | Redis integration and management |

## Files Preserved

All information from archived files has been preserved and enhanced in the consolidated guides. Nothing was lost in the consolidation process.

## When to Reference

Reference these archived files only if you need:
- Specific implementation details from a particular phase
- Historical context for how a feature evolved
