# Crypto Backtesting Updates - Default Time Range

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Feature:** Default 5-year time range with automatic data availability handling

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Default Time Range Set to 5 Years

**Previous Behavior:**
- Date fields were empty by default
- Users had to manually select dates or use all available data
- Help text said "Leave empty to use all available data"

**New Behavior:**
- **Start Date:** Automatically set to 5 years ago from today
- **End Date:** Automatically set to today
- Help text updated: "Default: Last 5 years (uses available data for each crypto)"

**Code Change:**
```javascript
// Set default date range (last 5 years)
const endDate = new Date();
const startDate = new Date();
startDate.setFullYear(endDate.getFullYear() - 5);

// Set default dates to last 5 years
$('#endDate').val(endDate.toISOString().split('T')[0]);
$('#startDate').val(startDate.toISOString().split('T')[0]);
```

### 2. Automatic Handling of Limited Data

**How It Works:**

The system is designed to work with ALL cryptocurrencies in the database, regardless of their data history length:

1. **When you request 5 years of data:**
   - Cryptos with 5+ years: Uses full 5-year range ✅
   - Cryptos with 3 years: Uses all 3 years available ✅
   - Cryptos with 1 year: Uses that 1 year ✅
   - Cryptos with no data: Returns empty result with message ✅

2. **Backend Logic:**
   ```python
   # get_price_data method automatically filters by available dates
   if start_date:
       query += " AND datetime >= %s"
   if end_date:
       query += " AND datetime <= %s"
   
   # Returns only the data that exists within the range
   df = pd.read_sql(query, conn, params=params)
   
   # If no data exists, returns empty DataFrame
   if df.empty:
       return self._empty_result("No price data available")
   ```

3. **Result Handling:**
   - Each result includes actual `start_date` and `end_date` used
   - Charts show actual data range for each crypto
   - Strategies run on whatever data is available

### 3. Benefits

**For Users:**
- ✅ **Consistent comparison period** - All cryptos evaluated over same requested timeframe
- ✅ **No manual date entry** - Ready to run immediately
- ✅ **Includes all cryptos** - Even those with limited history
- ✅ **Fair comparison** - Each crypto uses its available data within the range
- ✅ **Clear feedback** - Results show actual date range used

**For Analysis:**
- ✅ **Standardized testing** - 5-year window is common industry standard
- ✅ **Meaningful results** - Long enough to see patterns, trends, cycles
- ✅ **Recent relevance** - Excludes very old data that may not be relevant
- ✅ **Comparable returns** - All cryptos measured over same period when possible

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Bitcoin (Long History)
- **Requested Range:** 2020-10-05 to 2025-10-05 (5 years)
- **Available Data:** 2017-01-01 to 2025-10-05 (8+ years)
- **Data Used:** 2020-10-05 to 2025-10-05 ✅ Full 5 years
- **Result:** Complete 5-year backtest

### Scenario 2: New Crypto (Short History)
- **Requested Range:** 2020-10-05 to 2025-10-05 (5 years)
- **Available Data:** 2023-01-01 to 2025-10-05 (2 years)
- **Data Used:** 2023-01-01 to 2025-10-05 ✅ All available
- **Result:** 2-year backtest (best possible with available data)

### Scenario 3: Very New Crypto
- **Requested Range:** 2020-10-05 to 2025-10-05 (5 years)
- **Available Data:** 2025-01-01 to 2025-10-05 (9 months)
- **Data Used:** 2025-01-01 to 2025-10-05 ✅ All available
- **Result:** 9-month backtest (recent data only)

### Scenario 4: Batch Test with Mixed History
Running batch test on 48 cryptos:
- 30 cryptos: Full 5 years of data
- 12 cryptos: 2-4 years of data
- 6 cryptos: Less than 1 year

**Result:**
- All 48 cryptos are tested ✅
- Each uses maximum available data within 5-year window
- Results table shows actual date range for each
- Returns are calculated based on actual period used

## Technical Details

### Database Query Optimization

The system uses efficient date filtering at the database level:

```python
def get_price_data(self, crypto_id: int, start_date: str = None, end_date: str = None):
    """Get price data with optional date filtering"""
    query = """
        SELECT 
            DATE_TRUNC('day', datetime) as datetime,
            (ARRAY_AGG(open_price ORDER BY datetime ASC))[1] as open_price,
            MAX(high_price) as high_price,
            MIN(low_price) as low_price,
            (ARRAY_AGG(close_price ORDER BY datetime DESC))[1] as close_price,
            SUM(volume) as volume
        FROM crypto_prices 
        WHERE crypto_id = %s AND interval_type = '1h'
    """
    params = [crypto_id]
    
    if start_date:
        query += " AND datetime >= %s"
        params.append(start_date)
    if end_date:
        query += " AND datetime <= %s"
        params.append(end_date)
        
    query += " GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', datetime) ORDER BY datetime ASC"
    df = pd.read_sql(query, conn, params=params)
```

**Benefits:**
- Only fetches needed data from database
- Reduces memory usage
- Faster query execution
- Automatic handling of missing data

### Data Availability Check

The service checks data availability and handles edge cases:

```python
# Get available cryptocurrencies with minimum data requirements
cur.execute("""
    SELECT c.id, c.symbol, c.name,
           MIN(p.datetime) as start_date,
           MAX(p.datetime) as end_date
    FROM cryptocurrencies c
    INNER JOIN crypto_prices p ON c.id = p.crypto_id
    WHERE c.is_active = true
    GROUP BY c.id
    HAVING COUNT(p.id) > 100  -- At least 100 data points
    ORDER BY c.symbol
""")
```

**Minimum Requirements:**
- At least 100 data points (approximately 100 days)
- Active cryptocurrency status
- Valid price data in crypto_prices table

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if a crypto has less than 5 years of data?**  
A: It will use all available data within the 5-year window. For example, if a crypto only has 2 years of data, the backtest will run on those 2 years.

**Q: Will cryptos with different data lengths be comparable?**  
A: Yes, the return percentages are calculated based on the actual time period used. However, be aware that shorter periods may be less representative of long-term performance.

**Q: Can I still use all available data?**  
A: Yes! Click the "Clear Dates" button to remove the date filters, and the system will use all available data for each crypto.

**Q: Why 5 years instead of all data?**  
A: 5 years is a standard analysis period that:
- Captures multiple market cycles
- Excludes very old data that may not be relevant
- Provides faster processing
- Allows fair comparison across cryptos

**Q: What if I want a different default period?**  
A: You can manually change the dates to any range you prefer. The dates are just pre-filled as a starting point.

**Q: Does this affect single crypto backtests?**  
A: Yes, the same 5-year default applies to both single and batch backtests. You can always adjust the dates as needed.

**Q: Will the tooltip charts show the 5-year data?**  
A: Yes, the tooltip charts will show trade history and portfolio value over the date range used in the backtest.
