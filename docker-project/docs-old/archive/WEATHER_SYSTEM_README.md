# Automated Weather Data Collection System

## Overview

This system provides comprehensive weather data collection with two main components:

1. **Historic Weather Data**: 10 years of daily weather data automatically collected when new locations are added
2. **Current Weather Data**: Hourly collection of current weather conditions from yr.no API

## ‚úÖ System Status

**Complete and Operational:**
- üìä **18,255 historic weather records** (10 years √ó 5 locations)
- üå§Ô∏è **Hourly current weather collection** from yr.no API
- üèóÔ∏è **Automatic historic data collection** when new locations are added
- üìç **5 favorite locations** with complete coverage
- üóÑÔ∏è **Proper database indexing** for fast queries

## üéØ Key Features

### Automatic Historic Data Collection
- When a user adds a new favorite location, the system automatically starts collecting 10 years of historic weather data
- Uses Open-Meteo Historic Weather API
- Collects daily data: temperature (min/max/avg), humidity, precipitation, wind, weather conditions
- Background processing - doesn't block the user interface

### Hourly Current Weather Collection  
- Automated collection every hour at 5 minutes past the hour
- Uses yr.no API for real-time weather data
- Stores: temperature, humidity, pressure, wind, weather conditions, UV index
- 30-day retention policy (automatically cleans old data)

### Smart Data Management
- Duplicate prevention with unique constraints
- Incremental collection (only fetches missing data)
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- API rate limiting and respectful usage

## üîß Database Schema

### Tables Created
```sql
-- Historic weather data (10 years per location)
historic_weather_data
- temperature_min/max/avg, humidity_avg, precipitation_total
- wind_speed/direction, weather_symbol, pressure_avg
- Links to weather_locations

-- Current weather data (hourly updates)  
current_weather_data
- temperature, humidity, pressure, wind_speed/direction
- weather_symbol, weather_description, uv_index
- recorded_at (hourly), 30-day retention

-- Collection monitoring
historic_weather_collection_log
current_weather_collection_log
```

### Optimizations
- Proper indexes for fast queries by location and date
- Views for easy data access with location details
- Foreign key relationships maintaining data integrity

## üöÄ Scripts Available

### Data Collection
```bash
# Collect current weather for all locations
docker compose exec api python3 collect_current_weather.py

# Collect for specific location
docker compose exec api python3 collect_current_weather.py --location-id 1

# Collect historic data for new location (automatic when adding locations)
docker compose exec api python3 collect_historic_weather.py --location-id 5
```

### Monitoring
```bash
# Comprehensive status report
docker compose exec api python3 weather_status.py

# Historic data status only
docker compose exec api python3 historic_weather_status.py
```

## üìà Current Data Coverage

| Location | Historic Records | Current Data | Avg Temperature |
|----------|------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Lahti, Finland | 3,651 (100%) | ‚úÖ Active | 5.8¬∞C |
| Mikkeli, Finland | 3,651 (100%) | ‚úÖ Active | 5.5¬∞C |
| Valletta, Malta | 3,651 (100%) | ‚úÖ Active | 19.8¬∞C |
| Grindelwald, Switzerland | 3,651 (100%) | ‚úÖ Active | 8.7¬∞C |

## üîÑ Automation Status

### Triggers
- ‚úÖ **New Location Added** ‚Üí Historic data collection starts automatically
- ‚úÖ **Hourly Collection** ‚Üí Current weather updated every hour
- ‚úÖ **Error Recovery** ‚Üí Failed collections logged and can be retried
- ‚úÖ **Data Cleanup** ‚Üí Old current weather data removed after 30 days

### API Integration
- **yr.no**: Current weather and forecasts (respectful usage with proper User-Agent)
- **Open-Meteo**: Historic weather data (10-year coverage, global data)
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays and retry logic
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and status tracking

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Adding New Location (Automatic Historic Collection)
When you add a new favorite location through the weather dashboard:
1. Location is saved to database
2. Historic data collection starts automatically in background  
3. User sees confirmation message
4. 10 years of data collected over several minutes
5. Location appears in status reports with complete data

### Querying Data
```sql
-- Get temperature trends by month
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) as year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) as month,
    AVG(temperature_avg) as avg_temp
FROM historic_weather_data 
WHERE weather_location_id = 1
GROUP BY year, month;

-- Current weather conditions
SELECT city_name, temperature, weather_description, recorded_at
FROM current_weather_with_location
WHERE recorded_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY recorded_at DESC;
```

## üèÅ Next Steps Ready

The system is now fully operational and ready for:
- Weather trend analysis dashboards
- Climate pattern visualization  
- Historical weather comparisons
- Seasonal analysis and forecasting
- Weather API endpoints for applications
- Real-time weather monitoring interfaces

All infrastructure is in place for building advanced weather analytics and visualization features!
