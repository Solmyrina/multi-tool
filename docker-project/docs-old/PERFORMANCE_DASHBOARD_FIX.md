# Performance Dashboard Fix - October 8, 2025

## Problem
The enhanced performance dashboard page was loading but not populating any data in the new sections:
- Crypto Data Health
- Stock & Weather Data  
- Table Health & Dead Tuples
- Index Usage Statistics
- Query Performance Metrics

## Root Cause
The `/api/performance/database/health` endpoint was added to `app.py` **AFTER** the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block (around line 4798), which meant Flask never registered the route when the app started.

## Solution
Moved the endpoint definition to **BEFORE** the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block (line 4650), where all other routes are defined.

## Files Modified
1. `/home/one_control/docker-project/webapp/app.py`
   - Moved `@app.route('/api/performance/database/health')` to correct location
   - Removed duplicate endpoint definition

2. `/home/one_control/docker-project/webapp/templates/performance_dashboard.html`
   - Added enhanced error logging in JavaScript
   - Added response status checking

## Verification
```bash
# Check endpoint is registered
docker exec docker-project-webapp python3 -c "
from app import app
rules = [str(r) for r in app.url_map.iter_rules() if 'database/health' in str(r)]
print(rules)
"
# Output: âœ… Endpoint registered: /api/performance/database/health
```

## Result
The performance dashboard now correctly:
1. Loads all crypto/stock/weather data metrics
2. Shows dead tuple statistics for all tables
3. Displays index usage information
4. Shows query performance metrics
5. Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds

## Access
**URL:** http://localhost/performance (requires login)

The dashboard is now fully functional with all database health monitoring features operational.
