# AI Documentation Integration Note

**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Action**: Merged AI_PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.txt with README.md

## What Was Done

The comprehensive AI_PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.txt (originally in root) has been successfully merged into README.md to create a unified, comprehensive documentation file.
